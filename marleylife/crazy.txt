I'n'i build a cabin;
I'n'i plant the corn;
Didn't my people before me
Slave for this country?
Now you look me with that scorn,
Then you eat up all my corn.



I'n'i build a cabin;
I'n'i plant the corn;
Didn't my people before me
Slave for this country?
Now you look me with that scorn,
Then you eat up all my corn.



We gonna chase those crazy -
Chase them crazy -
Chase those crazy baldheads out of town!

/Scat singing/
---
Build your penitentiary, we build your schools,
Brainwash education to make us the fools.
Hate is your reward for our love,
Telling us of your God above.

We gonna chase those crazy -
Chase those crazy bunkheads -
Chase those crazy baldheads out of the yown!

/Instrumental break/
---
We gonna chase those crazy -
Chase those crazy bunkheads -
Chase those crazy baldheads out of the yown!

Here comes the conman
Coming with his con plan.
We won't take no bribe;
We've got [to] stay alive.


We gonna chase those crazy -
Chase those crazy baldheads -
Chase those crazy baldheads out of the yown.
