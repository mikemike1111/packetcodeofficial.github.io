<tr><td><p>A SKETCH OF RASTAFARI HISTORY by Norman Hugh Redington, Editor The St. Pachomius OrthodoxLibrary </p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p><h4>INTRODUCTION:</h4></p></td></tr> <tr><td><p>The spread of Orthodox Christianity in the New World has occurred mainly asa result of immigration from Eastern Europe. There are two regions, however, where this isnot the case: Alaska and the Caribbean. The story of the conversion of the Aleut, Tlingit,and Yupik nations in Alaska has often been told; by contrast, that of the yet moreimprobable emergence of Ethiopian churches in Jamaica is little known. My hope is thatthis little tract will inspire someone with greater knowledge to study the subjectproperly; if it also leads to a deeper respect and understanding between mainstreamChristians and the often-maligned brethren in Jamaica, may the Lord be praised.</p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p><h5>N.Redington, 1995</h5></p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p><h4>ORIGINS: </h4></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>THE GARVEYITE AFRICAN ORTHODOX CHURCH. Marcus Garvey was a Jamaican-born Blacknationalist leader whose Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) was the mostprominent Black Power organization of the 1920s. Although himself a Roman Catholic, Garveyencouraged his followers to imagine Jesus as Black and to organize their own church. Toemphasize that the new church was neither Catholic nor Protestant, the name"Orthodox" was adopted and the filioque (a phrase added to the Latin version ofthe Nicene creed in the early Middle Ages but rejected by the Orthodox) was dropped.</p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p>The African Orthodox Church entered into negotiations with the Russian Metropolia (now theOCA) for formal recognition as an Orthodox jurisdiction. Unfortunately, these negotiationsbroke down: the Metropolia demanded an unacceptable degree of administrative control,while the Garveyites wanted to promulgate whatever doctrines they chose. Eventually, theAfrican Orthodox bishop was consecrated by the "American Catholics", a groupwhich had rejected the authority of the Pope but was otherwise similar to the RomanChurch.</p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p>The Garveyite Church had thousands of members on three continents, and was a symbol ofanti-colonialism in Kenya and Uganda. The African Orthodox in those countries quicklybroke off relations with the New York church and instead became part of the GreekPatriarchate of Alexandria and fully Orthodox. The same process repeated in Ghana morerecently, where Fr. Kwami Labe, a graduate of St. Vladimir's Seminary in New York, hasbeen building a strong Orthodox community on the foundations laid by the Garveyites. (I amdistressed, however, that many now-canonical African Orthodox often seem almost ashamed oftheir "heretical" origins, and try to distance themselves from the earliermovement.)</p></td></tr>




<tr><td><p><h4>GARVEY THE PROPHET:</h4></p></td> </tr><tr><td><p>The Marcus Garvey of history books is a mainly political leaderinterested in making the black race economically equal with the white. In oral tradition,however, he appears as a divinely annointed prophet, the Forerunner of Haile Selassie. Inaddition to many miracles and prophecies, he is credited with having predicted that a"mighty king" would arise in Africa and bring justice to the oppressed. When thePrince (Ras) Tafari of Ethiopia was crowned emperor to world-wide fanfare, many Jamaicansclaimed the prophecy of Garvey had obviously just been fulfilled: the Ras Tafari Movementwas born.</p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p>Garvey himself was still alive, although his movement had largely collapsed and he himselfhad been jailed on (subsequently disproved) allegations of business fraud. Garvey was noadmirer of Haile Selassie, observing that slavery still existed in Ethiopia, and heattacked the Rastafarians as crazy fanatics. They, however continued to revere Garveynonetheless, remarking that even John the Baptist had had doubts about Christ!</p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p><h4>THE CLASSICAL PERIOD:</h4></p></td></tr><tr><td><p> From 1930 until the mid '60s, Rastafari was a local Jamaicanreligious movement with few outside influences. Several Garveyite leaders hadindependently declared that Haile Selassie fulfilled Garvey's prophecy, and the movementremained dominated by independent "Elders" with widely varying views. Not onlydid no Jamaica-wide "Rastafarian Church" develop, but there was not evenagreement on basic doctrine or a canon of Scripture--both the Holy Piby and the King JamesBible were used by various Elders, but were freely emended and "corrected".</p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p><h4>OVERSTANDING: </h4></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>This "anarchy" was considered a virtue by classical Rastas.Rastafari was not a religion, a human organization, or a philosophy, but an active attemptto discern the will of JAH (God) and keep it. Classical Rastas were mainly uneducatedThird World peasants, but they approached Rastafari in an almost Talmudic spirit, holding"reasonings" --part theological debate, part prayer meeting-- at which theyattempted to find the Truth.</p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p>Their attitude differed, however, from that of Protestants interpreting the Bible. Theywere certain that they would arrive, by divine guidance, at an "overstanding"(rather than understanding) of the Truth. The Truth cannot be known by human effort alone,but "Jah-Jah come over I&I", one can participate in the One who is Truth.</p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p><h4>MYSTICISM: <h4></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Early Rasta mystical experience emphasized the immediate presence of JAH withinthe "dread" (God-fearer). The doctrine of theosis was expressed with greatsubtlety (although not all Elders correctly distinguished essence from energy). Throughunion with JAH, the dread becomes who he truly is but never was, a process ofself-discovery possible only through repentance. (For this reason, Rastas did notproselytize, but relied on compunction sent by JAH.) The mystical union was expressed bythe use of the pronoun "I&I" (which can mean I, we, or even you, with JAHpresent) or simply "I" in contrast to the undeclined Jamaican dialect"me".</p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p><h4>COMMUNITY: </h4></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Many Rastas lived (and live today) in the bush in camps ruled by an Elder. Someof these camps are segregated by sex and resemble monasteries (down to the gong at thegate); more often, they are reconstituted West African villages. The dreads observe therules of "ital", a dietary code based on the Pentateuch with various additions,and otherwise observe a spiritual rule. Males are usually bearded (uncommon in Jamaicaduring the classical period, and a cause of social and religious discrimination, so thatRastas who held jobs often were "baldfaces" who kept their affiliation secret.)</p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p>The famous "dreadlocks" were worn during the classical period only by a minorityof dreads, mostly those who had taken the oath of Nazirite. Very recent historicalresearch suggests that the dreadlocks were popularized by a monastic movement whichopposed the unrestrained and potentially corrupting power of the Elders. These celibateand almost puritanical "nyabinghi warriors" objected particularly to "paganholdovers" in Rastafari, the continued use by dreads of ritual practices associatedwith the voudoun-like folk religion of the Jamaican peasantry.</p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p><h4>HINDUISM:</h4></p></td></tr> <tr><td><p>Another source of "pagan" thought in Rastafari was the religionpracticed by the thousands of East Indian labourers imported to Jamaica after theabolition of slavery. Classical Hinduism is a major religious force throughout the WestIndies, especially on Trinidad, but its influence on Rastafari has been little remarked.The dreadlocked, ganja-smoking saddhu or wandering ascetic is a well-known figure inIndia, and bands of saddhus often live in Rasta-style camps and smoke marijuana from aformally-blessed communal chalice-pipe. The Hindu doctrine of reincarnation is alsoadvocated by many dreads, although often with a subtle twist: to say that (for example)today's Jamaicans are reincarnated Israelites, and even "I myself have felt theslave-master's whip", means to some dreads not that they personally have livedbefore, but that their solidarity with their ancestors is so great that there is a"oneness through time".</p></td></td>


<tr><td><p><h4>REPATRIATION: </h4></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Among the few things all Elders agreed on were that Haile Selassie was"divine" (although what that meant was much debated) and that he intended torestore New World Blacks to Africa. Although a mystical interpretation of"repatriation" was advanced, there is no doubt that all early Elders (and mostmodern ones) expected outward literal return as well. This gave Rastafari an overtpolitical dimension: the Rastafarians all, without exception, wanted to immediatelyemigrate to Ethiopia. This was a situation with no analogue except Zionism, and was beyondthe ability of the Jamaican authorities to deal with. Revolutionaries are one thing, butthe Rasta slogan was not "power to the people", but "let my peoplego". As time passed, Rastafarian frustration at this unmet demand became explosive.</p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p>The situation grew especially tense after 1954, when the government overran a Rastafarianmini-state called the Pinnacle, ruled by Elder Leonard Howell in exactly the style of atraditional West African chief. Howell's followers migrated to the slums of Kingston, andthe movement went from a rural peasant separatist movement to one associated with theghettoes of the capital. In the late '50s and early '60s, a few Rastas in desparationrejected the non-violent teaching of all authentic Elders and mounted a series ofincreasingly violent uprisings, culminating in several deadly shoot-outs between Rastasand British troops.</p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p>With this violence, the existence of Rastafari came to (negative) worldwide notice; morepositive publicity was brought by the popularity of Rasta-performed reggae dance music afew years later. The classical period of isolation was at an end.</p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p><h4>ETHIOPIANISM: </h4></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>I will now treat the issue of direct contact between Rastafari and theEthiopian Orthodox Church.</p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p><h4>THE ETHIOPIAN WORLD FEDERATION (EWF): </h4>As an African country mentioned in the Bible and theonly African nation to successfully resist colonialism, Ethiopia was always prominent inNew World Black consci- ousness, but actual contact was minimal until the Second WorldWar. In 1937, Haile Selassie's government in exile founded EWF to raise money andpolitical support from Black nationalist groups in the West. After the war, the EWFcontinued to exist in various forms, some completely under local control but all providingat least some contact with Abyssinia.</p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p><h4>TRINIDAD & TOBAGO: </h4></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>In the 1940s, a Garveyite bishop named Edwin Collins set up what hesaid was a legitimate Coptic church under the Patriarch of Alexandria. However theGarveyite Coptics were tied more closely to the African Orthodox Church than to Egypt, andtheir canonicity was widely doubted. In 1952 the Garveyite Coptic diocese of Trinidad andTobago broke away and placed itself under Addis Ababa. Clergy were imported from Africaand a fully canonical church was organised in the islands. Trinidad is an EthiopianOrthodox success story: native- born clergy (including old-time Garveyite leaders) wererapidly ordained and parishes were founded all over the country and in Guyana.</p></td></tr>




<tr><td><p><h4>EWF RASTAFARI: </h4></td></tr><tr><td><p>Besides the heretical syncretist groups, however, a legitimate OrthodoxRastafari Movement continued to flourish as the backbone of the Jamaican church. The EWFunder the leadership of Dunkley and Hibbert had enormous prestige, being tied both to theroots of the movement in Garveyism and directly to Jamaica. The EWF retained the politicaland social aspects and the distinctive cultural features of classical Rastafari whileadvocating a rigorously correct and canonical Orthodoxy, venerating the Emperor as a holyliving ikon of JAH but not worshiping him. The first steps toward Orthodox Jamaica werebeing taken -- albeit by people whose main secular goal was to leave the country as soonas possible!</p></td></tr>




<tr><td><p><h4>REGGAE:</h4></p></td></tr><tr> <td><p>This was also the time when reggae music was at the height of its popularity, andwhen explicitly religious lyrics were the norm within reggae. Many popular bands wereOrthodox, notably The Abyssinians, a group with priestly and monastic connections. Thefamily of reggae's "superstar", Bob Marley, were mostly Orthodox, althoughMarley himself was for most of his career a member of the Twelve Tribes sect. In his lastyears, dying young of cancer, Marley underwent a remarkable spiritual transformation(evident in his music also) culminating in his baptism; his Orthodox funeral in 1981 wasattended by tens of thousands of mourners.</p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p>I believe that the Rastafarians have been greatly underestimated by theoutside world, including, to some extent, many elements in the Orthodox community. Theclassical Rastas were sophisticated theological and philosophical thinkers, notcargo-cultists worshiping newspaper photos of an African despot. They had discovered manysophisticated theological concepts for themselves, and had retraced many of theChristological and other debates of the early Church. They brought a truly rich culturaland artistic legacy, including some of the twentieth century's most moving hymnography..</p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p>While Abuna Yesehaq, at least, certainly seems to recognize this, in practise Rastas oftenseem to be told by the church that they must become Ethiopians in order to becomeOrthodox. Many are willing to do this, so great is their thirst for Truth and so acutetheir sense of having lost their true African culture. More, however, are not--and in away rightly so. The Church is the poorer to the extent it does not incorporate what isgood about the Rasta experience and instead tiresomely emphasizes the "heresy ofemperor-worship" and "herbal sorcery". What is forgotten is that theexistence of the Rastafari movement is a miracle: a forgotten people and a lost culturebringing itself by "reasonings" to the very edge of Orthodoxy. Surely this is asupernatural event, and so the Orthodox Rastas see it. An anonymous nyabingi chant goes:</p></td></tr>
