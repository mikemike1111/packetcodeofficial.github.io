Funeral Speech

<p class="main"> "His message was a protest against injustice, a comfort for the opressed. He stood there, performed there, his message reached there and everywhere. Today's funeral service is an international right of a native son. He was born in a humble cottage nine miles from Alexandrea in the parish of St.Ann. He lived in the western section of Kingston as a boy where he joined in the struggle of the ghetto. He learned the message of survival in his boyhood days in Kingston's west end. But it was his raw talent, unswerving discipline and sheer persiverance that transported him from just another victim of the ghetto to the top ranking superstar in the entertainment industry of the third world."<p>
